Mariupol serves as headquarters of the far-right group which is defending the city. Russia says they are Nazis and one of Vladimir Putin's justifications for launching the invasion has been his claim to "de-Nazify" Ukraine. So Russia continues to bomb the major city into rubble to kill its defenders and bring it under control.
Controlling Mariupol would enable Putin to establish a land corridor from Crimea - the peninsula he annexed from Ukraine in 2014 - to Donbas, the region parts of which have also been under the control of Russian-backed rebels since then and where Russia is now focusing the might of its military power.
